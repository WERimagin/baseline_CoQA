      "      \"story\": \"Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house, there lived a little white kitten named Cotton. Cotton lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn where all of the farmer's horses slept. But Cotton wasn't alone in her little home above the barn, oh no. She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton's mommy. Being different made Cotton quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing. \\n\\n\\\"What are you doing, Cotton?!\\\" \\n\\n\\\"I only wanted to be more like you\\\". \\n\\nCotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said \\\"Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way\\\". And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry. \\n\\n\\\"Don't ever do that again, Cotton!\\\" they all cried. \\\"Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!\\\" \\n\\nThen Cotton thought, \\\"I change my mind. I like being special\\\".\",\n",

They played all day long. \\n\\nOne day, a bottle floated by over the heads of Asta and his friends. They looked up and saw the bottle. \\\"What is it?\\\" said Asta's friend Sharkie. \\\"It looks like a bird's belly,\\\" said Asta. But when they swam closer, it was not a bird's belly. It was hard and clear, and there was something inside it. \\n\\nThe bottle floated above them. They wanted to open it. They wanted to see what was inside. So they caught the bottle and carried it down to the bottom of the ocean. They cracked it open on a rock. When they got it open, they found what was inside. It was a note. The note was written in orange crayon on white paper. Asta could not read the note. Sharkie could not read the note. They took the note to Asta's papa. \\\"What does it say?\\\" they asked. \\n\\nAsta's papa read the note. He told Asta and Sharkie, \\\"This note is from a little girl. She wants to be your friend. If you want to be her friend, we can write a note to her. But you have to find another bottle so we can send it to her.\\\" And that is what they did.\",\n",

      "      \"story\": \"My doorbell rings. On the step, I find the elderly Chinese lady, small and slight, holding the hand of a little boy. In her other hand, she holds a paper carrier bag. \\n\\nI know this lady. It is not her first visit. She is the boy's grandmother, and her daughter bought the house next door last October. \\n\\nHer daughter, Nicole, speaks fluent English. But she is now in Shanghai, and her parents are here with the little boy. Nicole has obviously told her mother that I am having heart surgery soon, so her mother has decided I need more nutrients. \\n\\nI know what is inside the bag--a thermos with hot soup and a stainless-steel container with rice, vegetables and either chicken, meat or shrimp, sometimes with a kind of pancake. This has become an almost-daily practice. \\n\\nCommunication between us is somewhat affected by the fact that she doesn't speak English and all I can say in Chinese is hello. Once, she brought an iPad as well as the food. She pointed to the screen, which displayed a message from her daughter telling me that her mother wanted to know if the food was all right and whether it was too salty. I am not used to iPads, so she indicated I should go with her to her house. Then, she handed the iPad to her husband and almost immediately I found myself looking at Nicole in Shanghai and discussing her mother's cooking and salt intake. Instantly, tears welled in my eyes. \\n\\n\\\"Your mother just can't be bringing me meals like this all the time,\\\" I insisted. \\\"I can hardly do dishes in return.\\\" \\n\\n\\\"Oh, no, Lucy.\\\" Nicole said. \\\"Mum doesn't like western food. Don't worry about it; she has to cook for the three of them anyway, and she wants to do it.\\\" \\n\\nThe doorbell keeps ringing and there is the familiar brown paper carrier bag, handed smilingly to me. \\n\\nI am now working on some more Chinese words--it's the least I can do after such display of kindness. \\n\\n\\\"Thank you\\\" is, of course, the first one. Somehow, it seems inadequate.\",\n",

      "      \"story\": \"(CNN) -- Dennis Farina, the dapper, mustachioed cop-turned-actor best known for his tough-as-nails work in such TV series as \\\"Law & Order,\\\" \\\"Crime Story,\\\" and \\\"Miami Vice,\\\" has died. He was 69. \\n\\n\\\"We are deeply saddened by the loss of a great actor and a wonderful man,\\\" said his publicist, Lori De Waal, in a statement Monday. \\\"Dennis Farina was always warmhearted and professional, with a great sense of humor and passion for his profession. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and colleagues.\\\" \\n\\nFarina, who had a long career as a police officer in Chicago, got into acting through director Michael Mann, who used him as a consultant and cast him in his 1981 movie, \\\"Thief.\\\" That role led to others in such Mann-created shows as \\\"Miami Vice\\\" (in which Farina played a mobster) and \\\"Crime Story\\\" (in which he starred as Lt. Mike Torello). \\n\\nFarina also had roles, generally as either cops or gangsters, in a number of movies, including \\\"Midnight Run\\\" (1988), \\\"Get Shorty\\\" (1995), \\\"The Mod Squad\\\" (1999) and \\\"Snatch\\\" (2000). \\n\\nIn 2004, he joined the cast of the long-running \\\"Law & Order\\\" after Jerry Orbach's departure, playing Detective Joe Fontana, a role he reprised on the spinoff \\\"Trial by Jury.\\\" Fontana was known for flashy clothes and an expensive car, a distinct counterpoint to Orbach's rumpled Lennie Briscoe. \\n\\nFarina was on \\\"Law & Order\\\" for two years, partnered with Jesse L. Martin's Ed Green. Martin's character became a senior detective after Farina left the show. \",\n",

Kendra lives further from the bus stop than Quinton does, stops every morning at Quinton's house to join him to walk to the bus stop. Every afternoon, after school, when walking home from the bus stop they go in for cookies and milk that Quinton's mother has ready and waiting for them. Quinton can't eat cheese or cake so they had the same snack every day. They both work together on their homework and when they are done they play together. Kendra always makes sure to leave in time to get home for dinner. She doesn't want to miss story time which was right before bedtime. \\n\\nOne morning Kendra walked up to Quinton's house, she thought something might be wrong because normally Quinton was waiting outside for her and on this morning he was not to be found. Kendra went up to the door and knocked. She waited and waited and yet no one answered. She saw that Quinton's mother's car wasn't in their driveway which was weird. She waited for a few bit looking up and down the block and getting worried when Quinton was nowhere to be found. \\n\\nKendra didn't want to miss the bus to school and hurried off to make it in time. The bus driver saw that she was upset and that Quinton was not with her that morning. She told him what happened and he said that he was sure that everything would be okay. \\n\\nKendra got to school, ran to her teacher and told him what happened that morning. The teacher smiled and told her not to worry, Quinton's mother had called and he was going to the dentist and would be at school after lunch and that she would see him at the bus stop like normal tomorrow.\",\n",

In the southwest of the city, Staten Island is the southernmost part of both the city and state of New York, with Conference House Park at the southern tip of the island and the state. The borough is separated from New Jersey by the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull, and from the rest of New York by New York Bay. With a 2016 Census-estimated population of 476,015, Staten Island is the least populated of the boroughs but is the third-largest in area at . Staten Island is the only borough of New York with a non-Hispanic White majority. The borough is coextensive with Richmond County, and until 1975 was the Borough of Richmond. Its flag was later changed to reflect this. Staten Island has been sometimes called \\\"the forgotten borough\\\" by inhabitants who feel neglected by the city government. \\n\\nThe North Shore\\u2014especially the neighborhoods of St. George, Tompkinsville, Clifton, and Stapleton\\u2014is the most urban part of the island; it contains the designated St. George Historic District and the St. Paul's Avenue-Stapleton Heights Historic District, which feature large Victorian houses. The East Shore is home to the F.D.R. Boardwalk, the fourth-longest in the world. The South Shore, site of the 17th-century Dutch and French Huguenot settlement, developed rapidly beginning in the 1960s and 1970s and is now mostly suburban in character. The West Shore is the least populated and most industrial part of the island.\",\n",

A violent storm was coming ,but it sounded like his small town wouldn't be hit too hard. But Eppes, a firefighter, had clearly known the power of these huge storms from experiences. \\\"Do you know where the flashlights are?\\\" he asked his wife. Danielle. Just then, thunder was all-around them. The moment he turned the flashlight on. The house lights went off. A second later, the kitchen windows were broken. Eppes and Danielle ran to their boys who were still sleeping in their bedroom. \\n\\n\\\"Get up, get up, R.J.! \\\" Eppes shouted, waving his flashlight. The sleepy boy moved to the edge of the bed. Eppes held out his arms and ordered his son to jump. He was too late. The roof was torn down. R.J. was buried ,under the pieces. \\n\\n\\\"I've lost him,\\\" Eppes thought. Quickly, he hurried to Joel to shield him. Glass, wood, and plaster ( ) hit them. Then something huge, heavy-maybe the washing machine-knocked into him. He hurt his arms, but he still held the flashlight in one hand. \\n\\nAfter a long period, the wind began to die down. Eppes found himself standing in the ruins of his home. Darkness lay all about him. Then he thought he saw a shape moving straight toward him. It was R.J., guided home by the light of his father's flashlight. \\n\\nAt the hospital later, R.J. described what had happened to him. \\\"I rushed out when the wall started moving I was scared. My mom and dad were gone. Pieces of glass hit my back, and something hit my neck really hard. \\\" \\n\\nR.J. had been raised up into the air by the wind and dropped back to the ground. Amazingly, R.J. was not hurt badly. Of all his family, Eppes was hurt most seriously.\",\n",

      "      \"story\": \"(CNN) -- FBI agents on Friday night searched the Maryland home of the suspect in the recent disappearance of an American woman in Aruba, an agent said. \\n\\nThe search is occurring in the Gaithersburg residence of Gary Giordano, who is currently being held in an Aruban jail, FBI Special Agent Rich Wolf told CNN. \\n\\nAgents, wearing vests that said FBI and carrying empty cardboard and plastic boxes, arrived about 8:40 p.m. Friday. About 15 unmarked cars could be seen on the street, as well as a Montgomery County police vehicle. \\n\\nSupervisory Special Agent Philip Celestini, who was at the residence, declined to comment further on the search, citing the active investigation. \\n\\nAruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said earlier Friday that the suspect will appear in court Monday, where an investigating magistrate could order him held for at least eight more days, order him to remain on the island or release him outright due to a lack of evidence. \\n\\nGiordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. \\n\\nGiordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, Giordano allegedly said. \\n\\nThe area that Giordano led authorities to is a rocky, unsightly location that locals say is not a popular snorkeling spot. \\n\\nAlthough prosecutors have continued to identify the 50-year-old American man by his initials, GVG, they also released a photo of a man who appears to be Giordano. His attorney, Michael Lopez, also has said that his client is being held as a suspect in Gardner's death. Lopez has not returned telephone calls seeking comment. \",\n",

      "      \"story\": \"Which country grows the most tea? The answer is India. It grows three times as much as China. Which country drinks the most tea? It's neither China nor Japan. It's Great Britain. In the wild, tea plants may be 30 feet tall. But a plant grown for market is pruned. Pruning keeps the plant only three or four feet tall. This is an easy height for tea picking. Only the two top leaves and bud of each new shoot are picked. So to make money, tea plantations must be huge. In general, there are two kinds of tea. Black tea and green tea. Black tea is fermented. In the process, the tea loses nearly all of its healthy qualities. Green tea is steamed right after the leaves are picked. Green tea _ its healthy qualities. For example, it may prevent heart disease. How did we get tea bag? The answer: by accident. Tea merchants used to send samples in tin boxes. This was costly. One merchant thought of a cheaper way. He sent samples in small silk bags. Customers would cut open the bag. They would brew the leaves as usual. One customer put the bag into a pot. Then he just poured hot water over it. And the tea bag was born. Shen Nong was the first to drink tea. (Shen was a Chinese emperor.) This was about 2737 B.C. Shen had bad digestion. So he drank several cups of hot water daily. One day something happened. Leaves from a wild tea tree fell into the hot water pot. The next cup was poured. The water was now colored. Shen sipped it. He liked it. He drank it all. Shen was proud of his new drink. He served it to his guests. Word spread. People thought this way. Tea is good enough for the Emperor. So it must be good enough for the people. Tea became the drink of China.\",\n",

      "      \"story\": \"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The German news outlet Der Spiegel has published photographs of what appear to be two U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan posing over the bodies of dead Afghans -- images which threaten to further complicate the American military effort there. \\n\\nTwo images show the soldiers kneeling by a bloody body sprawled over a patch of sand and grass. A third shows what appears to be two bodies propped up, back to back, against a post in front of a military vehicle. \\n\\nDer Spiegel identifies the soldiers as Spc. Jeremy Morlock and Pfc. Andrew Holmes, who are both facing charges relating to the wrongful deaths of Afghan civilians. \\n\\nSpecifically, Holmes is charged with the premeditated deaths of three civilians, possessing a dismembered human finger, wrongfully possessing photographs of human casualties, and smoking hashish. \\n\\nHe is also accused of conspiring with Morlock to shoot at a civilian and then toss a grenade so it would look like the soldiers were under attack. \\n\\nMorlock is charged with three counts of murder. He is accused of killing one Afghan civilian in January 2010 with a grenade and rifle; killing another in May 2010 in a similar manner; and shooting a third to death in February 2010. \\n\\nU.S. military rules also prohibit \\\"taking or retaining individual souvenirs or trophies,\\\" which the photographs may be construed as. \\n\\nThe trial for the two soldiers is being conducted at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. Morlock's court martial is slated to begin Wednesday, while the start date for Holmes' court martial has not been publicly announced. \",\n",

      "      \"story\": \"OCLC, currently incorporated as OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Incorporated, is an American nonprofit cooperative organization \\\"dedicated to the public purposes of furthering access to the world's information and reducing information costs\\\". It was founded in 1967 as the Ohio College Library Center. OCLC and its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat, the largest online public access catalog (OPAC) in the world. OCLC is funded mainly by the fees that libraries have to pay for its services (around $200\\u00a0million annually ). \\n\\nOCLC began in 1967, as the Ohio College Library Center, through a collaboration of Ohio university presidents, vice presidents, and library directors who wanted to create a cooperative, computerized network for Ohio libraries. The group first met on July 5, 1967 on the campus of the Ohio State University to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization. The group hired Frederick G. Kilgour, a former Yale University medical school librarian, to design the shared cataloging system. Kilgour wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time, the computer, with the oldest, the library. The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations, control costs, and increase efficiency in library management. The goal of this network and database was to bring libraries together to cooperatively keep track of the world's information to best serve researchers and scholars. The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the Alden Library at Ohio University on August 26, 1971. This was the first occurrence of online cataloging by any library worldwide.\",\n",

They seemed very sad. \\n\\n\\\"What is wrong?\\\" Tommy asked. \\n\\nMary, one of the little mice, stood. \\\"My brother and I love to see new things. We want to see what is on the other side of the lake. But we do not know how to build a boat to get there.\\\" \\n\\nTommy smiled. \\\"I have plenty of toy boats,\\\" he said. \\\"They are your size!\\\" \\n\\n\\\"Oh, thank you!\\\" said Steve, the other little mouse. \\\"We would be very glad if we could borrow it!\\\" \\n\\nTommy went to his house and returned with a small toy boat. The boat had a big sail to make the boat go. Mary and Steve climbed on and Tommy put the boat into the water. \\n\\nThe boat sailed away across the water! Mary and Steve laughed with joy and had great fun riding the toy boat. \\n\\nSoon, they reached the other side of the lake. Many people were having fun swimming and splashing in the water. Steve and Mary loved seeing all the new things and people. \\n\\nA man threw a ball into the water. It landed by the toy boat. The man's big dog came splashing into the water to fetch it. The big waves splashed the little boat every which way! Mary and Steve got very wet. \\n\\nMary and Steve went back home after that. They told Tommy of what they saw, and they all laughed at the big dog's wave. Tomorrow the mice would see even more of the lake on Tommy's toy boat!\",\n",

      "      \"story\": \"A German taxi-driver, Franz Bussman, recently found his brother who was thought to have been killed twenty years ago. \\n\\nWhile on a walking tour with his wife, he stopped to talk to a workman. After they had gone on, Mrs. Bussman said that the workman was closely like her husband and even suggested that he might be his brother. Franz laughed at the idea, pointing out that his brother had been killed in action during the war. Though Mrs. Busman knew this story quite well, she thought there was a chance in a million that she might be right. \\n\\nA few days later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him if his name was Hans Bussman. Needless to say, the man's name was Hans Bussman. And he really was Franz's long-lost brother. \\n\\nWhen the brothers were reunited, Hans explained how it was that he was still alive. \\n\\nAfter having been wondered towards the end of the war, he had been sent to hospital and was separated from his unit . The hospital had been bombed and Hans had made his way back into Western Germany on foot. Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed. Hans returned to his home, but the house had been bombed up. Guessing that his family had all been killed during an air-raid , Hans settled down in a village fifty miles away where he had remained ever since.\",\n",

For Harley and Villa Kennan were in no hurry. So long as the way was interesting, they dared not how long it proved from anywhere to anywhere. \\n\\nDuring this time Jerry learned a new name for himself--or, rather, an entire series of names for himself. This was because of an aversion on Harley Kennan's part against renaming a named thing. \\n\\n\\\"A name he must have had,\\\" he argued to Villa. \\\"Haggin must have named him before he sailed on the _Arangi_. Therefore, nameless he must be until we get back to Tulagi and find out his real name.\\\" \\n\\n\\\"What's in a name?\\\" Villa had begun to tease. \\n\\n\\\"Everything,\\\" her husband retorted. \\\"Think of yourself, shipwrecked, called by your rescuers 'Mrs. Riggs,' or 'Mademoiselle de Maupin,' or just plain 'Topsy.' And think of me being called 'Benedict Arnold,' or ' Judas,' or . . . or . . . 'Haman.' No, keep him nameless, until we find out his original name.\\\" \\n\\n\\\"Must call him something,\\\" she objected. \\\"Can't think of him without thinking something.\\\" \\n\\n\\\"Then call him many names, but never the same name twice. Call him 'Dog' to-day, and 'Mister Dog' to-morrow, and the next day something else.\\\" \",\n",

      "      \"story\": \"Brownie and Spotty were neighbor dogs who met every day to play together. These two loved each other and played together so often that they had worn a path through the grass of the field between their respective houses. One evening, Brownie's family noticed that Brownie hadn't returned home. They went looking for him with no success and by the next week he was still missing. Curiously, Spotty showed up at Brownie's house alone. Barking, whining and generally pestering Brownie's human family. Busy with their own lives, they just ignored the nervous little neighbor dog. Continuously,Ted, Brownie's owner, was disturbed by the angry, determined little dog. Spotty followed Ted about, barking insistently, then rushing toward a nearby empty lot and back, as if to say, \\\"Follow me! It's urgent!\\\" Eventually, Ted followed Spotty to a deserted spot half a mile from the house. There Ted found his beloved Brownie alive, one of his hind legs crushed in a steel leghold trap. Horrified, Ted now wished he'd taken Spotty's earlier appeals seriously. Then Ted noticed something quite remarkable. Spotty had done more than simply led Brownie's human owner to his trapped friend. In a circle around the injured dog, Ted found an array of dog food and table scraps which were later identified as the remains of every meal Spotty had been fed that week! Spotty had been visiting Brownie regularly, in the hope of keeping his friend alive by sacrificing his own comfort. Spotty had evidently stayed with Brownie to protect him from hunger and other dangers, and keep his spirits up. Brownie's leg was treated by a veterinarian and he recovered. For many years thereafter, the two families watched the faithful friends chasing each other down that well worn path between their houses.\",\n",

Upon entering the woods the girl and her dog found that the woods were dark and cold. The girl was a little scared and was thinking of turning back, but yet they went on. The girl's dog was acting very interested in what was in the bushes up ahead. To both the girl and the dog's surprise, there was a small brown bear resting in the bushes. The bear was not surprised and did not seem at all interested in the girl and her dog. The bear looked up at the girl and it was almost as if he was smiling at her. He then rested his head on his bear paws and went back to sleep. The girl and the dog kept walking and finally made it out of the woods. To this day the girl does not know why the bear was so friendly and to this day she has never told anyone about the meeting with the bear in the woods.\",\n",

Williams of the Harris County Sheriff's Department. \\n\\nAn investigation found that Rick James Lohstroh, 41, was shot by his son, who was sitting in the back seat of the man's Toyota 4-Runner, said Sgt. Williams. The shooting took place outside the home of Lohstroh's ex-wife, where the boy lives with his mother and a 7-year-old brother. \\n\\n\\\"We're not certain of anything until we finish our investigation,\\\" Williams said. \\\"The information we have at this time is that the 10-year-old did fire the weapon.\\\" \\n\\nThe mother and the 7-year-old were inside the house when the shooting occurred, said Williams. \\n\\nWilliams said the gun belonged to the boy's mother. After firing shots through the back seat, the boy exited the back of the vehicle and continued to fire at the car. \\n\\nThe man died on the way to Memorial Herman Hospital. \\n\\nLohstroh was a doctor at the University of Texas Medical Branch. \\n\\nThe man and woman shared custody of the children. \\n\\nWilliams said the mother and the boy were still in the home talking to investigators Friday night. \\n\\nNeighbors described the family as being quiet and keeping to themselves. \\n\\nJustin Gray, 17, was walking in the neighborhood when he heard gunshots. \\\"We've had a suicide in this neighborhood once, but never anything like this,\\\" Gray said.\",\n",

      "      \"story\": \"CHAPTER FIFTY FIVE. \\n\\nWAITING. \\n\\nThe lengthening sunny days went on without bringing either what Romola most desired or what she most dreaded. They brought no sign from Baldassarre, and, in spite of special watch on the part of the Government, no revelation of the suspected conspiracy. But they brought other things which touched her closely, and bridged the phantom-crowded space of anxiety with active sympathy in immediate trial. They brought the spreading Plague and the Excommunication of Savonarola. \\n\\nBoth these events tended to arrest her incipient alienation from the Frate, and to rivet again her attachment to the man who had opened to her the new life of duty, and who seemed now to be worsted in the fight for principle against profligacy. For Romola could not carry from day to day into the abodes of pestilence and misery the sublime excitement of a gladness that, since such anguish existed, she too existed to make some of the anguish less bitter, without remembering that she owed this transcendent moral life to Fra Girolamo. She could not witness the silencing and excommunication of a man whose distinction from the great mass of the clergy lay, not in any heretical belief, not in his superstitions, but in the energy with which he sought to make the Christian life a reality, without feeling herself drawn strongly to his side. \\n\\nFar on in the hot days of June the Excommunication, for some weeks arrived from Rome, was solemnly published in the Duomo. Romola went to witness the scene, that the resistance it inspired might invigorate that sympathy with Savonarola which was one source of her strength. It was in memorable contrast with the scene she had been accustomed to witness there. \",\n",

Watch a report on Richardson's life \\u00bb \\n\\n\\\"She did not show any visible sign of injury, but the ski patrol followed strict procedures and brought her back to the bottom of the slope and insisted she should see a doctor,\\\" the statement said. \\n\\nRichardson, accompanied by her instructor, returned to her hotel, but about an hour after the fall was \\\"not feeling good,\\\" the statement said. An ambulance was called, and Richardson was taken to a local hospital before being transferred to Hopital du Sacre-Coeur in Montreal. From there she was transferred to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \\n\\nFriends and colleagues were saddened by her death. \\n\\n\\\"Natasha was brilliant, beautiful, funny, talented beyond measure, as emotionally raw as she was razor sharp,\\\" said Jodie Foster, who worked with Richardson in \\\"Nell,\\\" in a statement. \\\"Tasha loved fiercely and that love continues in all of us who knew her. May Liam, her beautiful boys and her loving family hold her close as they move through this tragic moment.\\\" \",\n",

Peter had seen many other puppies find a person; he began to wonder why he could not get one. He thought that maybe his fur was not pretty enough or maybe his bark was not loud enough. He tried and tried to please every person who came to the store, but they all picked smaller puppies. However, one day all of this changed. Sammie came into the store looking for a golden puppy. She wanted a puppy she could snuggle with. It so happened that Peter was very sad and tired that day. Sammie came to hold him. Peter wanted to show off his bark, but he was too tired. He fell right to sleep. Sammie loved him at once and loved holding him in her arms. Sammie took Peter home that day, and they made lots of fun memories.\",\n",

The movie is about a poor man Ti, his son Dicky and their alien dog CJ7. Dicky, a 10-year-old boy, lives a poor life with his father Ti, a worker. One day,his father finds a ball in the trash and he gives it to Dicky. The ball becomes a cute alien dog. It's a small dog with big eyes and green hair. It can talk and do magic . Soon the dog comes to love Ti and his son. It goes to school with Dicky. It makes him laugh, but it makes trouble, too. When Ti falls off a building and dies, CJ7 saves his life. Because the dog loses all its power , it becomes a doll. But Dicky still wears the dog around his neck. He hopes that CJ7 will come back to life one day.\",\n",

One day,his father finds a ball in the trash and he gives it to Dicky. The ball becomes a cute alien dog. It's a small dog with big eyes and green hair. It can talk and do magic . Soon the dog comes to love Ti and his son. It goes to school with Dicky. It makes him laugh, but it makes trouble, too. When Ti falls off a building and dies, CJ7 saves his life. Because the dog loses all its power , it becomes a doll. But Dicky still wears the dog around his neck. He hopes that CJ7 will come back to life one day.\",\n",

It wasn't exactly the most efficient system. \\n\\nThen last year, during one of her browsing sessions, she read a blog post that gushed about a new website called Pinterest. The virtual pinboard, where users can pin and organize images onto individual \\\"boards,\\\" didn't pique Neroy's interest at first, but she quickly changed her mind. \\n\\n\\\"Someone described it as an online filing system, and I thought, 'That's exactly what I need,' \\\" she said. \\n\\nSoon Neroy was pinning away and, like many Pinterest users, got quickly hooked. She first started with a Halloween board where she pinned costume ideas. Next, Neroy created a shared color board for redecorating her daughter's bedroom that she and her husband could add to. \\n\\nPinterest also allows other users to follow each other's boards and \\\"re-pin\\\" another person's images. In no time Neroy was sharing other people's pins and following users with similar tastes. \\n\\n\\\"It's been really neat to see what other moms are pinning,\\\" she said. \\\"Some days you run out of ideas and you don't know what to do to fill the time before bedtime. I thought it was going to be just me organizing, but it's really a community sharing all these different ideas that I didn't even know existed.\\\" \",\n",

A traitor had just come in and told them where Bruce had slept the night before. Reluctantly Archie unfastened the chain from the pole, and holding the end in his hand went round with Hector to the front of the pavilion. He was resolved that if under the dog's guidance the party came close up with Bruce, he would kill the dog and then try to escape by fleetness of foot, though of this, as there were so many mounted men in the party, he had but slight hope. Led by the peasant they proceeded to the hut, which was five miles away in the hills. On reaching it Hector at once became greatly excited. He sniffed here and there, eagerly hunted up and down the cottage, then made a circuit round it, and at last, with a loud deep bay he started off with his nose to the ground, pulling so hard at the chain that Archie had difficulty in keeping up with him. Pembroke and his knights rode a little behind, followed by their men-at-arms. \\n\\n\\\"I pray you, Sir Earl,\\\" Archie said, \\\"keep not too close to my traces, for the sound of the horse's hoofs and the jingling of the equipments make him all the more impatient to get forward, and even now it taxes all my strength to hold him in.\\\" \",\n",

      "      \"story\": \"Asuncion, Paraguay (CNN) -- Paraguay installed new top military commanders, but President Fernando Lugo, who had ordered the change in leadership, was not present for the ceremony. \\n\\nLugo's absence Thursday morning attracted attention given his administration's silence on the sudden change in the leadership of the country's army, air force and navy. \\n\\nThe president's decision to replace the top brass came a day after he publicly dismissed rumors about a military coup. \\n\\nBrig. Gen. Bartolome Ramon Pineda Ortiz was named as the new army commander. Brig. Gen. Hugo Gilberto Aranda Chamorro and Rear Adm. Egberto Emerito Orie Benegas took over the top posts at the air force and navy, respectively. \\n\\nThe announcement came from the armed forces, not the president's office. \\n\\nCibar Benitez, commander of the armed forces, was the only top leader to retain his post. \\n\\nOther changes would be forthcoming in the lower ranks, said Benitez at the swearing-in ceremony, but he denied there was any truth to talk of a coup. \\n\\nParaguay's history is filled with unstable transitions of power since it emerged from dictatorship in 1989. Although there hasn't been a coup since that year, there were attempted coups in 1996 and 2000, and President Raul Cubas resigned amid controversy in 1999. \\n\\nThe military shakeup is the third since Lugo took office. The former Catholic bishop was elected to a five-year term last year. His victory brought an end to six decades of one-party rule in Paraguay, but the honeymoon did not last long. \\n\\nIn April, Lugo admitted that he fathered a child while he was still a priest and that he may have fathered more. The revelation, which came as a shock to most, hurt his political image. Calls for his resignation began, and have continued as Lugo has struggled to push reforms through a majority-opposition legislature. \",\n",

Her mom joined her and brought a pear to eat later on as a snack. They went to the first store and the woman tried on a dress. It cut off right at the knee. She liked the dress so much she bought it. When they went back to their car they saw a bug had splashed on her window. They thought nothing of it and wanted to go eat breakfast since it was nine in the morning. Instead the restaurant was cooking peas. The mom asked the cashier why they were cooking peas. The cashier said because it was opposite day. The woman and her mom wanted to eat the peas and bought steaks as well. They were liking the peas and steak so much. After eating, they got a vanilla milkshake and went to more stores to shop for fun.\",\n",

      "      \"story\": \"Buckinghamshire ( or ), abbreviated Bucks, is a county in South East England which borders Greater London to the south east, Berkshire to the south, Oxfordshire to the west, Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north east and Hertfordshire to the east. \\n\\nBuckinghamshire is one of the home counties and towns such as High Wycombe, Amersham, Chesham and the Chalfonts in the east and southeast of the county are parts of the London commuter belt, forming some of the most densely-populated parts of the county. Development in this region is restricted by the Metropolitan Green Belt. Other large settlements include the county town of Aylesbury, Marlow in the south near the Thames and Princes Risborough in the west near Oxford. Some areas without direct rail links to London, such as around the old county town of Buckingham and near Olney in the northeast, are much less populous. The largest town is Milton Keynes in the northeast, which with the surrounding area is administered as a unitary authority separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire. The remainder of the county is administered by Buckinghamshire County Council as a non-metropolitan county, and four district councils. In national elections, Buckinghamshire is considered a reliable supporter of the Conservative Party.\",\n",
